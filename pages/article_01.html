                        The library p5.js aims to provide a tool for making coding in the context of "visual art" more
                        accessible for artists, designers and everybody else interested in this topic.

                        The Maurer Rose algorithm was first published in 1987 by Peter M. Maurer and allows to create
                        beautiful geometric roses by coding.
                        The playground is the polar coordinate system where the following formula is applied: <i>r =
                        sin(n&theta;)</i>.
                        In this example, <i>n</i> is a positive integer. If <i>n</i> is odd, the rose is going to have
                        <i>n</i> petals, and <i>2n</i> if <i>n</i> is even.
                        The rose itself consists of walking along a <i>n</i> or <i>2n</i> leafed rose in 360 steps of a
                        fixed number <i>d</i> (degrees) including all cosets.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The code example in p5.js has two main functions, the <span class="code">setup()</span>
                        and the <span class="code">draw()</span> function.
                        The <span class="code">setup()</span> function is called once when the page is initialized.
                        Environment parameters such screen size, fonts or background colors are declared here.
                        The following block is showing the configuration used by the Maurer Rose generator.
                        First, a canvas is created and two sliders are defined. Using the sliders the user can
                        interact and create different parameter combinations at a later stage that allow for the
                        creation of beautiful Maurer roses.
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/riorudo/7ab3fe590e184a14bffc376e80d820dc.js"></script>

                    <p>Called directly after <span class="code">setup()</span>, the <span class="code">draw()</span>
                        function continuously executes the lines of code
                        contained inside its block until the program is stopped or <span class="code">noLoop()</span> is
                        called.</p>
                    <p>
                        As shown in the code snipped below, the first two lines in the <span class="code">draw()</span>
                        function set the background color to black and the stroke color to the defines RGB colors (see
                        code of <i>maurer_rose_full.js</i> at the end of the article),
                        followed by the assignment of the slider values to the variables <i>n</i> and <i>d</i>.
                        On the next line, some stroke properties are set as <span class="code">noFill()</span> and <span
                            class="code">strokeWeight()</span>.
                        Finally, we get to the core part of the <span class="code">draw()</span> function. This consists
                        of a for - loop which iterates over 360 points and connects them depending on the parameters <i>n</i>
                        and <i>d</i>.
                        The <span class="code">vertex()</span> function is used to move the drown shape to the center of
                        the canvas.
                        At this point, the shape is closed by <span class="code">endShape()</span> and the parameters
                        <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are displayed in the canvas.
                        But the maurer rose is not completed yet. The structure is finalized but the petals of the rose
                        are not present yet.
                        In order to achieve this, we have to repeat the loop using a slightly adapted algorithm. For
                        this purpose, we change the color to blue and the value <i>k</i> is now calculated without the
                        parameter <i>d</i> (<i>d</i> is set to 1).

                    <p>The second part of the of the Maurer Rose SVG generator deals with the generation of a SVG
                        graphic from the displayed maurer rose for downloading it.
                        Thus, a new function <span class="code">doubleClicked()</span> is created. This function can be
                        executed by a double click on the canvas.
                        This method generates the exact same maurer rose as displayed and saves it to an SVG graphic
                        with the parameters <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> as part of the file name.</p>
